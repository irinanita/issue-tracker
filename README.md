> # Milestone Project for Code Institute - Full Stack Frameworks with Django Module - By Irina Nita
---
This project is an Issue Tracker build with Django. As it is clear from the name this web app is an issue tracker.
Easy to use and very efficient for team work. The web app itself is a demo version of the final product. By registering
to the demo version users can contribute to its improvement and give it a go to see its awesome features. Then they can purchase
this app  to make working on their own projects more efficient and clear for the entire team involved.

> Note : This is the initial version of the Readme file while the whole project is still at the beginning, so it may be subjected to
considerable changes until the final version. All the features and UX ar still to be implemented. 

## UX
There are two categories of users registered and not, both of them represent potential customers that may be buying the app.
* **NOT** registered users .Will be shown only the landing page with all the details and reasons why this app may be useful to them. They will be prompted to register and try out the app.
* **Registered** users. Will have access to all the web app's functionalities
* Carousel displayed for both users as registered users may not have yet purchase the product this may be a reminder and a prompt why they should
* Any action can be finalized in less than two steps
* Feedback is given at the end of important events through Alert Messages
* Navigation throughout the website is simple and intuitive
* Colour palette is meant to make content easily readable and eye pleasing, providing good contrast between text and background

## Version Control
Git is used for version control.  Commits made at any significant change

## Deployment
This Project was deployed with Heroku in the following way:
* Create Heroku account
* Login into Heroku from console `heroku login`
* Create a new empty App on Heroku as none was created before `heroku create` 
* Rename App `heroku apps: rename issue-tracker`
Run this command from App's Root. The empty Heroku Git repository is automatically set as a remote for your local repository.
Check `git remote -v`
* Create a `Procfile` (instruction to Heroku as which file should be used as an entry point for our App)
The `Procfile` must be in your appâ€™s root directory `echo web python app.py > Procfile`
* Create a requirements.txt file `sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
* To deploy `git push heroku master`
* Set the `IP`,`PORT`, `SECRET_KEY` and any other environment variables in Heroku Account Settings

It is also possible to configure GitHub integration for a Heroku app, Heroku can automatically build and release (if the build is successful) pushes to the specified GitHub repo.
